# Spark Training

## Modules

1. API Walkthrough
Spark has two primary APIs, and we'll explore both of them by
looking a little more closely at the Word Count exercise

1. Log Analysis
In Log Analysis, we're stepping away from Word Count, and getting
into more data analysis. This starts the practical part of the
training. There are two submodules. One for the Exercise, and one
for a solution that I came up with... Don't look at the solution
yet!

1. Word Count Example
"Word Count" is the "Hello World" of the "Big Data" world. We'll
compare the way to do Word Count with Hadoop MapReduce, and Spark
using both the RDD and Dataset APIs
